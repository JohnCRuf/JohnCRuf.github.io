Hello, I'm John Ruf and I am applying to PhD programs this year.
Currently I am an RP under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Dingel](https://www.jdingel.com/) at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 
I am interested in industrial organization, innovation, and spatial economics.
Please find my most up-to-date CV and writing sample above.
